        <ul>
            <li>It was introduced in ES5, is a way to opt into restricted mode of javascript opting out of sloopy mode.</li>
            <li>Changes made by strict mode.
                <ol>
                    <li>Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.</li>
                    <li>Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that's not strict mode.</li>
                    <li>Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.</li>
                </ol>
